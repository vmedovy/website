# Blog

This repository contains all the code contained in my blog.

## Handling

### Local preview

To locally serve a live preview of the website, run

```sh
hugo serve --buildDrafts --disableFastRender
```

`--disableFastRender` is highly recommended by the `uBlogger` theme as it uses `.Scratch` (see [official documentation](https://ublogger.netlify.app/theme-documentation-basics/)).

### Configuration

See the [configuration section of the official documentation](https://ublogger.netlify.app/theme-documentation-basics/#3-configuration).
