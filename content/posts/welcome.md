A few days ago I decided to start a blog and write about programming. As you can see, I already accomplished the first step: Setting up the static site generator __Hugo__ and deploying the generated page to my server. You are welcome to join me on my blogging journey and dive into different topics with me.

The input files to generate this website using __Hugo__ are going to be available [here](https://github.com/vmedovy/website).
